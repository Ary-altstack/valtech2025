Sure! Here's a small assignment that covers Comparator, Comparable, hash methods, Stream API, and Lambda expressions in Java.

Assignment
Create a program that manages a collection of Student objects with the following attributes:

name (String)
age (int)
gpa (double)
Create a Student class with the attributes above.

Implement the Comparable interface to allow sorting students by name in alphabetical order.
Override the toString method to print the studentâ€™s details.
Create a StudentComparator class that implements the Comparator interface.

Implement two different comparators:
One to sort students by age in ascending order.
One to sort students by gpa in descending order.
Use a HashSet to store students.

Override the hashCode and equals methods to ensure students with the same name and gpa are considered equal.
Create a list of students and populate it with at least 5 students.

Sort the list using the default natural order (using Comparable), then by age, and then by GPA using the respective comparators.
Use Java Streams:

Filter students who are older than 20.
Sort them by GPA (using a Lambda expression inside sorted()).
Print the students using the forEach method with a Lambda expression.
